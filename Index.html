<h1>Overview </h1>



<p id="para">Here are where my personal projects are kept and blogged during their progress. Blogs will discuss how I went about doing it, the time it took and anything I could have done better for next time. All the projects are personal and some may be a bit less serious than others depending on my interest as that moment. 
and for example, heres my dog.
