<h2> Worksheet review </h2>
<p id="para">The worksheets have helped me understand the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to good degree now. I found CSS the easiest whilst finding JavaScript the hardest of all of them due it to being more of a coding language than HTML. I learnt a lot more about each area thanks to these worksheets and found the idea of expanding on previous worksheets being an interesting and fun concept to work around with. I do wish there was a bit more worksheets to allow us to explore more concepts for building the websites and maybe the worksheets themselves being a bit more informative on how to do some of the things in the worksheets. For example, the final worksheet on resizing the imagery could have been a bit more concise on what they would like for us to do. Overall, however I have found these worksheets and the course as a whole to be quite enjoyable for me and the lectures helped expand on my knowledge which I was able to put into practise during the worksheets.</p>
